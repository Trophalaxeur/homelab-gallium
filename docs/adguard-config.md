# AdGuard Home Configuration Reference

## Web Interface

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `bind_host` | `0.0.0.0` | Listens on all interfaces so the LXC responds to requests from the local network. Use `127.0.0.1` to restrict to local only. |
| `bind_port` | `3000` | Web UI port. Avoids conflicts with other HTTP services. Can be changed to `80` if no other service runs on it. |
| `auth_attempts` | `5` | Maximum failed login attempts before blocking the IP. Lower to `3` for stricter security. |
| `block_auth_min` | `15` | Duration in minutes an IP is blocked after exhausting auth attempts. |

## DNS — Listening & Resolution

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `dns.bind_hosts` | `0.0.0.0` | DNS listens on all interfaces — required to serve the whole LAN. |
| `dns.port` | `53` | Standard DNS port. Cannot be changed — all DNS clients expect port 53. |
| `upstream_dns` | Quad9 DoH + Cloudflare DoH | Encrypted DNS over HTTPS. Two providers for redundancy with different geographies. |
| `bootstrap_dns` | `9.9.9.9`, `1.1.1.1` | Plain DNS used at startup to resolve the DoH upstream URLs before the encrypted resolvers are reachable. |

### Upstream DNS alternatives

| Provider | DoH URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Quad9** *(current)* | `https://dns10.quad9.net/dns-query` | Switzerland-based, malware filtering, privacy-focused |
| **Cloudflare** *(current)* | `https://dns.cloudflare.com/dns-query` | Very fast, logs deleted within 24h |
| NextDNS | `https://dns.nextdns.io/<id>` | Highly configurable, detailed logs, freemium |
| DNS0.eu | `https://dns0.eu/` | European, GDPR-compliant, no-log |
| Google | `8.8.8.8` | Simple but unencrypted and logged by Google |

## Performance & Cache

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `cache_size` | `4194304` (4 MB) | In-memory DNS cache. Sufficient for a homelab. Can be raised to 16 MB without notable impact. |
| `cache_optimistic` | `true` | Serves a cached response even after TTL expiry, then refreshes it in the background. Reduces perceived latency. |
| `ratelimit` | `20` | Maximum DNS requests per second per client IP. Protects against DNS loops or buggy clients. Set to `0` to disable. |
| `refuse_any` | `true` | Rejects `ANY` query type, which is commonly abused for DNS amplification DDoS attacks. |

## Filtering & Security

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `filtering_enabled` | `true` | Core AdGuard feature — blocks ads and trackers via blocklists. |
| `filters_update_interval` | `24` (hours) | How often blocklists are refreshed. `12`h for more reactivity, `24`h is a reasonable default. |
| `blocking_mode` | `default` | Returns `0.0.0.0` for blocked domains. Alternatives: `nxdomain` (domain not found) or a custom IP pointing to a block page. |
| `enable_dnssec` | `false` | DNSSEC validates DNS response signatures. Disabled here to avoid latency and compatibility issues with domains that don't support it. Can be enabled for extra security. |

### Active blocklists

| List | Content |
|---|---|
| AdGuard DNS filter | Ads, trackers, malware — broad general-purpose list |
| AdAway Default Blocklist | Mobile ads and trackers — Android-oriented |

### Other popular blocklists

- **OISD** — very comprehensive, low false-positive rate
- **HaGeZi** — multiple aggression levels (light → ultimate)
- **Steven Black Hosts** — ads + fake news

## Logging & Statistics

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `querylog_enabled` | `true` | Logs every DNS query. Useful for diagnostics and monitoring client behavior. |
| `querylog_interval` | `90d` | Retention period for query logs. Reduce to `7d` if disk space is limited (LXC is 4 GB). |
| `statistics_interval` | `7d` | Time range displayed in the dashboard statistics. |

## Local DNS Rewrites

Rewrites allow AdGuard to resolve custom local hostnames without a full DNS server.

| Domain | Resolves to | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `proxmox.lan` | `192.168.1.32` | Proxmox web UI |
| `adguard.lan` | `192.168.1.53` | AdGuard Home web UI |

The `.lan` suffix is a convention for non-routable local domains.
Alternatives: `.home`, `.internal`.
Avoid `.local` — it is reserved for mDNS (Bonjour/Avahi) and can cause conflicts.

## Disabled Features

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `dhcp.enabled` | `false` | DHCP is handled by the Livebox 6. Enable only if you want AdGuard to replace it. |
| `tls.enabled` | `false` | No HTTPS/DoT/DoQ for now. Can be enabled later with a certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt via a reverse proxy). |
| `parental_enabled` | `false` | Parental controls — not needed here. |
| `safebrowsing_enabled` | `false` | Google Safe Browsing integration — adds latency, disabled by default. |
